\section{Introduction}

This document describes \key{MINVAL}, the Minimal Runtime System Virtual
Assembly Language.

\section{Overview}

A typical MINVAL statement is:
\begin{center}
\tt int X = Y + Z
\end{center}
This allocates a new variable {\tt X} of type {\tt int}
to the stack, and sets its value to that value of the
variable {\tt Y} plus the value of the variable {\tt Z}.
Most variables in the stack have a size equal to the natural
word size of the computer (typically 32 or 64 bits), or
several times that size: {\tt intd} is a two word (double) integer
and {\tt intq} is a four word (quad) integer.

Variables have names, like {\tt X}, {\tt Y}, and {\tt Z},
and locations in memory where their values are stored.

Locations can be complicated.  The statement:
\begin{center}
\tt Y \TILDE{} Gobbledeegook
\end{center}
makes the variable {\tt Y} synonymous with the
global variable {\tt Gobbledeegook} in the current
module.  {\tt Gobbledeegook} will have a location that
is at a offset address in the current module global memory, and
a type, such as `{\tt dp uns8}', which says it is a
direct pointer to a one byte unsigned integer, a.k.a., a character.
Direct pointers are stored in words.

The location of {\tt X} is an address in
the frame of the current function execution.

The statement
\begin{center}
\tt Z \TILDE{} Gobbledeegook[W]
\end{center}
makes {\tt Z} synonymous with {\tt Gobbledeegook}
indexed by the variable {\tt W}.  If {\tt W} is an
integer, the address of {\tt Z} the address
of {\tt Gobbledeegook} plus the value of {\tt W}
times the size of {\tt uns8}.

Now suppose
\begin{center}
\tt W \TILDE{} Gook
\end{center}
where {\tt Gook} is a global variable of type {\tt int16},
a signed 16 bit integer.  Then to execute
\begin{center}
\tt int X = Y[4] + Z
\end{center}
the computer must:
\begin{enumerate}
\item read the value of {\tt Y} which is the location of {\tt Gobbledeegook}
\item add {\tt 4} to this location
\item read the value of {\tt Y[4]} from this location and convert it
      to an {\tt int}
\item read the value of {\tt W} from the location of {\tt Gook} and
      convert it to an {\tt int}
\item add the value of {\tt W} to the location of {\tt Gobbledeegook}
      to get the location of {\tt Z}
\item read the value of {\tt Z} from this location and convert
      it to an {\tt int}
\item store the sum of the converted values of {\tt Y[4]} and {\tt Z} into {\tt X}
\end{enumerate}

Now there is a very important difference between {\tt X} on one
hand, and {\tt W}, {\tt Y} and {\tt Z} on the other.  When we call an
out-of-line function and then return, we can expect the value of
{\tt X} to be the same as before the call, but the values of
{\tt W}, {\tt Y} and {\tt Z} may have changed.  This is because the out-of-line
function and functions it calls can access the locations of {\tt W}, {\tt Y}
and {\tt Z}, but not the location of {\tt X}.

The expressions that compute locations have a limited structure,
so that the operations used consists of reading variables or constants,
adding values, multiplying values by constants, and shifting values
left or right by a constant number of bits.  More specifically, a
location as follows:
\begin{indpar}\begin{tabular}{rcl}
{\em location} & ::= & {\em global} $|$ {\em local} $|$ {\em base}
                   $|$ {\em offset} $|$ {\em indexed}
\\[0.5ex]
{\em global} & ::= & constant location provided by loader \\
       &     & (e.g., of a string constant); \\
       &     & not used for variables
\\[0.5ex]
{\em local} & ::= & location at a constant offset from the
                  current frame pointer \\
          & $|$ & location at a constant offset from the
	          current \\
          &     & module memory pointer
\\[0.5ex]
{\em indirect} & ::= & {\tt int} byte address read from a {\em local} location
\\[0.5ex]
{\em double-indirect} & ::= &
    {\tt int} byte address read from an {\em indirect} location
\\[0.5ex]
{\em base} & ::= & {\em indirect} $|$ {\em double-indirect}
\\[0.5ex]
{\em offset} & ::= & {\em base} + constant
\\[0.5ex]
{\em index} & ::= & {\tt int} read from {\em local} location \\
      & $|$ & {\tt int} read from a {\em offset} location
\\[0.5ex]
{\em indexed} & ::= & {\em base} + constant + constant * {\em index} \\
        &     & where if the {\em index} is read from
	        an {\em offset} location \\
	&     & the {\em base} of that {\em offset} location
	        must be the \underline{same} \\
	&     & as the {\em base} of the {\em indexed} expression
\end{tabular}\end{indpar}

Lastly after the above have computed the byte address of a location,
a location can optionally be a field of a word stored at that
byte address, where the field is designated by specifying:

\begin{itemize}
\item a one word mask selecting the bits of the field
\item the number of bits to the left of the field in the word
\item the number of bits to the right of the field in the word
\end{itemize}

MINVAL has a full set of number types:
{\tt int8}, {\tt uns8},
{\tt int16}, {\tt uns16}, {\tt flt16}, \ldots,
{\tt int128}, {\tt uns128}, {\tt flt128}.
The types {\tt int}, {\tt uns}, {\tt flt} are just these
types for the target machine word size, and the types
The types {\tt intd}, {\tt intq}, {\tt unsd}, {\tt unsq} are just integer
types for twice (double) or four times (quad) the target machine word size.
The {\tt bool} type is a single bit interpreted as {\tt true} if
1 and {\tt false} if 0: it is in essence a 1-bit unsigned integer.

There are also two kinds of user defined types: packed numbers
and structures.

An example packed number is:

\begin{indpar}\begin{verbatim}
packed uns32 my_type:
    [0-7]    uns op_code              // Operation
    [0]      bool has_constant        // Format indicator
    [8-31]   int constant             // Constant
    [8-15]   uns src1                 // Source Register
    [16-23]  uns src2                 // Source Register
    [24-31]  uns des                  // Destination Register

. . . . . . . . . . . .

my_type X = ...
uns op = X.op_code
int c = X.constant
Y ~ X.des
\end{verbatim}\end{indpar}

A packed number is a number ({\tt uns32} in the example)
that contains fields.  Each field occupies a sequence of
bits in the number ({\tt op\_code} occupies bits 0 through 7
in the example), and this sequence is interpreted as a
number, {\tt int}, {\tt uns}, or {\tt flt}, or as a {\tt bool},
and is given
a name ({\tt op\_code}, {\tt has\_constant}, etc.~in the
example).

Notice that fields can overlap.

Examples of structures are:

\begin{indpar}\begin{verbatim}
struct my_type:
    pack
    uns8    kind                     // Object Kind
    flt64   weight                   // Object Weight
    align   64
    label   extension

struct my_type:
    origin  extension
    align
    flt64   height                   // Object height
    flt64   width                    // Object height

struct my_type:
    origin  extension
    align
    flt64   volume                   // Object volume

struct your_type:
    include my_type   // Copy members of my_type
    dp uns8 name      // Direct pointer to name
                      // character string

. . . . . . . . . . . .

my_type X = ...
X.kind = BOX
X.weight = 55
X.height = 1023
X.width = 572

struct your_type Y
Y.kind = BEER
Y.weight = 0.45
Y.volume = 48
Y.name = "John Doe"
\end{verbatim}\end{indpar}

A structure is a byte sequence that contains members
(e.g., {\tt kind}, {\tt weight}, {\tt height}, etc. in
the example).
Each member has an offset in bytes from the beginning of the
structure (e.g. {\tt kind} is offset 0 and because it is
packed, {\tt weight} has offset 1).  A {\tt label} is like
a zero length member that has no value, and is used to
position other members via the {\tt origin} statement.
The {\tt include} statement copies members from another
structure type.

In this case {\tt extension} is aligned on a 64 bit boundary.
A structure type has an
alignment equal to the greatest common multiple of the
alignments of its members.

Structure types can be extended
(as per the example), and members can overlay each other.
A structure has a size in bytes just large enough to
accommodate all its members.

Structure types per say cannot be used as variable values.
Instead, pointers to structure types must be used.  In the
example {\tt my\_type} and {\tt your\_type} are types of
direct pointers, which are {\tt int} values containing
addresses.  Similarly {\tt X} and {\tt Y} are pointers.
Here {\tt X} is allocated by an out-of-line function call
denoted by {\tt \ldots}, while {\tt Y} is placed into the
current function execution frame.  In spite of this last,
{\tt Y} is still a pointer.

MINVAL has multiple pointer types.  The builtin ones are:
\begin{itemize}
\item[{\bf dp}] Direct Pointer.  An {\tt int} value holding
the byte address of the bytes pointed at.
\item[{\bf ip}] Indirect Pointer.  An {\tt int} value holding
a byte address of a {\tt int} value holding the byte address
of the bytes pointed at.
\item[{\bf op}] Offset Pointer (a.k.a., indirect offset pointer).
An {\tt intd} value half of which holds an {\tt int} offset $O$ and
the other half of which holds and {\tt int}
byte address of an {\tt int} base value $B$.  $B+O$ is the byte
address of the bytes pointed at.
\item[{\bf fp}] Field Pointer.  An {\tt intq} value, half of
which is an offset pointer pointing at an {\tt int} in memory,
and the other half of which holds the following which defines a field in that
{\tt int}: (1) an {\tt int} mask for
the bits of the field in the field's containing {\tt int},
(2) the number of bits to the left (high order side) of the field in
its {\tt int}, and
(3) the number of bits to the right (low order side) of the field in
its {\tt int}.

\end{itemize}

In the example above, {\tt name} is a direct pointer to an unsigned
byte, allowing expressions such as {\tt Y.name[i]} for an index variable
{\tt i}.

Some pointer types can be converted to other pointer types.
All the builtin pointer values can be converted to direct
pointers, as is done when calling legacy library functions
written in the C programming language.  Direct pointer values
can be converted to offset pointer values by using a base ($B$)
equal to zero and setting the offset ($O$) equal to the
direct address.

The default pointer type of a structure is direct, but this
can be changed, e.g., to indirect.  The MIN runtime system
requires that pointers be indirect or indirect offset.

New pointer types may also be defined by the user.

By default, functions in MINVAL are inline.  For example,

\begin{indpar}\begin{verbatim}
function int r = max ( int x, int y ):
    if x < y:
        r = y
    else:
        r = x

int x = ...
int y = ...
int z = max ( x, y )
\end{verbatim}\end{indpar}

An assignment statement can contain a single function call
or a single operator, but not both, and not more than one.
For example, given the definition of {\tt max} above:

\begin{indpar}\begin{verbatim}
int x = ...
int y = ...
int z = ...
int w = max ( x, max ( y, z ) )    // Illegal
int w1 = max ( y, z )              // OK
int w2 = max ( x, w1 )             // OK
\end{verbatim}\end{indpar}

Although variables in assignment statement operands cannot be
replaced by expressions involving variables, they can be replaced
by expressions involving constants.  Constants are their own
type, {\tt const}, and named constants can be created by assignment
statements.  For example, using the definition of {\tt max} above:

\begin{indpar}\begin{verbatim}
const x = 5
const y = 1e8
const z = x + y
const w = z / x + y
int u = ...
int v = max ( u, z / x + w * y )
\end{verbatim}\end{indpar}

Constant arithemtic is in effect infinite precision with unbounded
numbers.  Constant numbers can be converted to any of the runtime
number types, but if the result will not fit in a runtime integer,
a compiler error occurs.  This happens, for example, if {\tt 1e20}
is converted to an {\tt int32}.

It is possible to define inline functions that execute at assembly
time:

\begin{indpar}\begin{verbatim}
function const r = max ( const x, const y ):
    if x < y:
        r = y
    else:
        r = x

const x = 2e5
const y = 3e6
const z = 9e4
const w = max ( x, max( y, z ) )  // Legal!
\end{verbatim}\end{indpar}

Inline function definitions may make use of type wildcards.
A name that consists of only an initial {\tt T}
followed by one or more decimal digits is a type wildcard, that denotes
an arbitary type.  Thus the example:

\begin{indpar}\begin{verbatim}
function T1 r = max ( T1 x, T1 y ):
    if x < y:
        r = y
    else:
        r = x

const x = 2e5
int y = 27e4;
int z = max ( x, y )      // Converts x to int.
const w = 34e4;
const v = max ( x, w )    // All values are const.
\end{verbatim}\end{indpar}

A wildcard type of a result variable gets its value from the
type of the result variable in a function call.  The exception
is {\tt const}, which can be a wildcard type in a function
definition if and only if all type wildcards in the function definition
are assigned the value {\tt const} and doing so makes
all types in the function definition be {\tt const}
(except for types that are not used as types, but are used as
{\tt const} values, as in `{\tt sizeof ( int )}').

Pointer types can be wildcards which must have names consisting
of an initial {\tt P} followed by one or more decimal digits.
An example is:

\begin{indpar}\begin{verbatim}
function int r = strlen ( P1 uns8 s ):
    r = (int) C::strlen ( (dp) s ) )
\end{verbatim}\end{indpar}

which converts the point of type {\tt P1} to a pointer of
type {\tt dp} (direct pointer) and calls the C programming
language subroutine {\tt C::strlen} with the direct pointer.

MINVAL does not necessarily make any use of registers, other
than as temporaries during the execution of a single statement,
and a pair of registers that hold the current function
execution frame address and current module data address.
However, registers can be used to cache data that exists in
RAM memory, or that should exist in RAM memory but does not
due to optimization.  We call such registers software
caches.

Software caches of a RAM memory location are flushed when an out-of-line
function is called if (1) the location is not in the currently
executing function frame, or (2) the location is part of a
section of the currently executing function frame to which
a pointer (direct, indirect, offset, etc.) has been computed.

In addition to having a type and optionally a pointer type,
variables may have qualifiers.  The only qualifiers are
{\tt ro} and {\tt vo}.

{\tt ro} variables are read-only and
cannot be written.  However, they may be writable by
code located elsewhere, so it cannot be assumed they will
never change.  Therefore the {\tt ro} qualifier does not
affect software cacheing.

{\tt vo} variables are volatile, and may be changed asynchronously
between any two reads of the variable.  {\tt vo} variables are
\underline{not} cached in software registers.


\section{Syntax}


\section{Assembly Time}

Statements and functions, all of whose varibles are of {\tt const}
type, execute solely during assembly, and never at run time
(when the assembled program is running).  Constants are all of
type {\tt const}.

\subsection{Assembly Time Data}

Assembly time data consists of {\tt const} values.
There are 4 types of {\tt const} values: integers, rationals, strings,
and maps.

\key{Integers} are unbounded and can be arbitrarily long.
Any sequence of lexemes that is a
number representative\pagnote{NUMBER-REPRESENTATIVES}
that evaluates to an integer
can be used to represent an integer {\tt const}.

\key{Rationals} are pairs of unbounded integers, a numerator and a denominator.
The later must be greater than zero.  The greatest common divisor
of the numerator and denominator must be 1.
Any sequence of lexemes that is a
number representative\pagnote{NUMBER-REPRESENTATIVES}
that evaluates to a non-integer
can be used to represent an rational {\tt const}.

\key{Strings} are character strings, represented by quoted string lexemes.

\key{Maps} have two parts.  The \key{vector} part maps small
natural numbers in the range $[0,n-1]$ to values, where $n$
is the length of the vector.  The \key{dictionary} part maps
character string \key{labels} to values.

Labels that begin with '{\tt .}' are \key{hidden} and do not
print.  Maps that have no non-hidden labels are called \key{lists}.

Maps are represented by comma separated lists of elements inside
{\tt [~]} brackets, with list elements being represented by
just their value, and dictionary elements being represented
by the syntax `label {\tt =>} value'.\pagnote{MAP-REPRESENTATIVES}

The parser translates an input text into nested lists.  These
lists have a {\tt .position} hidden label whose value specifies
the position in the input of the text that produced the list.
Some of the lists have an {\tt .operator} hidden label whose
value specifies the operator in the list, which has usually
been moved to the beginning of the list.  Logical lines,
indented paragraphs, and parenthesized subexpressions
are lists with {\tt .initiator} and {\tt .terminator}
hidden attributes.
